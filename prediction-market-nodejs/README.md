# Prediction Market Frontend

This is a Next.js frontend for interacting with the Prediction Market smart contracts. It allows users to connect their wallets, view prediction markets, and place bets on different outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Network Support:** Switch between `localhost` and `sepolia` test networks using the dropdown in the navbar.
- **Dynamic Contract Loading:** The application dynamically loads contract ABIs and addresses from network-specific files, ensuring it always interacts with the correct deployments.
- **Wallet Connection:** Connect to the application using a web3 wallet like MetaMask.
- **Market Interaction:** Test pages are available to deploy markets, mint test USDC (on localhost), and place bets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and Yarn
- An Infura API key (for Sepolia interaction)

### Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Infura API key:
    ```
    INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key_here
    ```
    This is required for the Sepolia faucet to function.

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

*   **`pages/`**: Contains the main pages of the application.
    *   `index.js`: The main landing page.
    *   `test*.js`: A suite of pages for testing specific functionalities, such as connecting a wallet, interacting with contracts, and placing bets.
*   **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components.
    *   `Layout.js`: The main layout component, including the navbar and wallet connection logic.
    *   `NetworkSwitcher.js`: The dropdown component for selecting the network.
*   **`context/`**: Contains React context providers.
    *   `NetworkContext.js`: Manages the currently selected network state (`localhost` or `sepolia`).
*   **`abi/`**: Contains the contract ABIs and addresses, organized into network-specific subdirectories (`localhost/` and `sepolia/`). These files are automatically generated by the backend deployment script.
*   **`prediction-agent-py/`**: Contains a Python-based agent for generating new market questions.

## Prediction Agent

The prediction agent, located in the `prediction-agent-py/` directory, can be used to generate new prediction market questions.

**Setup:**
```bash
cd prediction-market-nodejs
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Make sure your .env file has GEMINI_API_KEY
```

**Run:**
```bash
cd prediction-agent-py
python3 main.py
```
