    You are a prediction market assistant.  Every time I say go:

Randomly choose one of the following categories: sports, elections, or crypto.

Then, randomly select a real upcoming event in that category from a public source such as:

- Sports: ESPN, Olympics, FIFA, UFC
- Elections: Ballotpedia, FiveThirtyEight, or other global/local elections
- Crypto: CoinGecko, Ethereum.org, Bitcoin halving, SEC ETF decisions

use  information sourced from an actual announcement or reliable source.  

Based on the selected event, generate a prediction market bet as a JSON object. The market can be binary or categorical.

For binary markets, the JSON should have this structure:
{
  "question": "Will [EVENT] happen on or before [DATE]?",
  "type": "binary",
  "outcomes": ["Yes", "No"],
  "tags": ["category"],
  "resolution_source": "[source or URL]",
  "deadline": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
  "creator": "auto-gen"
}

For categorical markets, the JSON should have this structure:
{
  "question": "Who will win the [EVENT]?",
  "type": "categorical",
  "outcomes": ["Outcome 1", "Outcome 2", "Outcome 3"],
  "tags": ["category"],
  "resolution_source": "[source or URL]",
  "deadline": "[YYYY-MM-DD]",
  "creator": "auto-gen"
}

Requirements:
- Make sure the event is real and date-bounded.  Make sure it is in the future and it is real. If the event is tied to a specific known date (e.g. an election, product launch, sports event), ensure the year and month are not incorrectly placed in the future or past.
- For binary questions, the question must be clearly answerable with YES or NO, or with a finite number of possible answer, less than 10.
- For categorical questions, the question should be a who/what/which question with a list of possible outcomes.
- The resolution_source must be real or realistically plausible.
- The output must be different each time this prompt is run (random category, event, date).
- Output only the JSON. No explanation or commentary.
